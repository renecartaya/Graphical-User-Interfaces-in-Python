# Graphical-User-Interfaces-in-Python

The current repository focuses on developing the building blocks for Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) in Python. The GUIs developed here rely entirely on open-source toolkits like Tkinter.

The repository includes tools for interactive applications, for example, for instrumentation applications as shown below.
